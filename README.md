# SHINA - Reimagining your in-store experience 
The project is part of SI 699 UX mastery course at the Univeristy of Michigan's School of Information. The project aims to to reassess what it means to visit a physical store and design a service and system that not only enhances shoppersâ€™ experience in the physical store but also enables stores to complement and compete with their virtual counterparts. We attemped to implement some of the core features of the product, using Framer X and React. To access the demo, please follow the instructions below.

**Note**: the prototype only allows you to interact with some features of the system.

## Installation
Download the entire framerx file and open it with Framer X. To install Framer X, please go to https://framer.com/.

## Demo
After opening the project in Framer X, allow 10 seconds for API and components to fully load. You can start preview (cmd+p) from the Splash page.
